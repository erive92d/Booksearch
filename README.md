## Introduction

MERN BookSearch is a full-stack web application that allows users to create accounts, search for books, and save their favorite books to their profiles.

The application is built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The frontend is built using React.js, while the backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. The application's database uses MongoDB.
